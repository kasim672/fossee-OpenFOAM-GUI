Statement of Purpose

I am Kasim Ishaque Ghanchi, a Second-Year engineering student with a strong interest in programming, scientific computing, and problem-solving. I enjoy building systems that are not only functional but also well-structured and efficient. My core technical interests lie in Python programming, data structures, and software development practices.

Through my academic journey, I have worked on multiple programming projects that strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming, modular code design, and debugging. I am particularly interested in how software can be applied to solve real-world engineering and scientific problems. This interest naturally led me toward scientific and simulation-oriented software ecosystems.

The OpenFOAM GUI project appeals to me because it combines programming with engineering applications. I find it exciting to work on tools that simplify complex workflows for engineers and researchers. Contributing to such a project would allow me to apply my programming skills in a meaningful and impactful way while learning how large-scale scientific software is designed and maintained.

While I am still early in my engineering career, I am a fast learner and enjoy understanding systems deeply rather than superficially. I am comfortable reading documentation, experimenting independently, and improving code quality through iteration. I also value writing clean, maintainable code and following good software practices.

I see this opportunity not just as an internship, but as a chance to grow as a developer and contribute to open-source scientific tools that help the engineering community. I am motivated to learn from the FOSSEE team and contribute sincerely to the project.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute and learn.
